## Task 1
Add an option to specify a directory to be used to store user's shopping cart eg.

    java shoppingcart.jar cartdb

where *cartdb* is a directory to be used to store user's cart. If a program is started without specifying the cart database directory, then the program will default to use a directory called *db*. If this directory does not exist, create it.

## Task 2
Implement the following additional commands (in addition to those from day 1 workshop)
- *login* - load the specified user's database file from the shopping cart directory. If the database file does not exist, create the file. Eg
    login fred
will load the file *cartdb/fred.db* where *cartdb* is the shopping cart directory

- *save* - save the contents of the cart to the user's shopping cart file eg *cartdb/fred.db*. If you try to save without first login as a particular user, you should print a message reminding the user to first login as a particular user.
The save format witll be described below.

- *users* - list all users; this is the listing all the filenames under the shopping cart directory

Create a class called *ShoppingCartDB* to manage the database; the class should contain methods like load a shopping cart, save a shopping cart, etc.

## Task 3
You should save the contents of a shopping cart as text file. If fred has the following items in his cart: apple, orange, pear then his cart will be stored as follows
    cartdb/fred.db
    apple
    orange
    pear
